## 🌟 Project Overview

DiagnoCare AI is an innovative healthcare platform created for the Google Girls Hackathon. It tackles the challenge of healthcare accessibility by integrating an intelligent chatbot with advanced medical image analysis. Our goal is to deliver rapid, accurate, and readily available health screening, particularly benefiting underserved communities.


## AI-Powered Healthcare Chatbot 🏥
A multilingual, high-performance healthcare assistant powered by OpenAI's language models, designed to provide real-time medical insights and symptom assessment.

## 🌟 Key Features

### Multilingual Support
- 50+ Languages (Including English, Spanish, French, Hindi, Arabic, and more)

- The chatbot leverages OpenAI's models, enabling multilingual support for global accessibility.
- Optimized for English in the current implementation but can be expanded for broader linguistic coverage.

### Response Time
- ⚡ 1.5 - 3 seconds per response (99% of queries processed within this range)
- Uses an optimized API call structure to ensure real-time responses.
